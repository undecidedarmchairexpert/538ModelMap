# Note
I did this because one of my friends expressed disappointment with the lack of a map in the official 2020 election model at 538. I wanted to explain to him why the map was fundamentally flawed in the first place and used this as a tool to explain this. Don't take this map literally, it is not updated live and the visualisations over at 538 serve better to explain the uncertainty around elections, particularly this one.
